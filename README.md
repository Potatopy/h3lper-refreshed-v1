# h3lper-refreshed
This is a multi-purpose bot made by zach.#0001 + others.

# Features

- Moderation Commands
- Advanced Ticket System
- Leveling System
- Economy - NOTE: This is a local database if you want to make it into the mongo database. You have to modify the whole code for that
- ~~Music~~ this is held off due to the limited documentation on the discord-player website
- ~~AI Image Generation~~ - same reason with music commands

I know a lot of features have been cut off but I will try my best to find replacements!
