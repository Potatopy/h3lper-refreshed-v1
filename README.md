# h3lper-refreshed
This is a multi-purpose bot made by zach.#0001 + others.
turns out the command handler is broken lmao

# Features

- Moderation Commands
- Advanced Ticket System
- Leveling System - WIP im just lazy lmao
- Status updater - NOTE: If you are going to use this globaly. Remove the command cause it shows everywhere.
- Economy - NOTE: broken atm until i get smarter
- ~~Music~~ this is held off due to the limited documentation on the discord-player website
- ~~AI Image Generation~~ - same reason with music commands (except with craiyon)

I know a lot of features have been cut off but I will try my best to find replacements!
