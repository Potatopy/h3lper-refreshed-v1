This is a multi-purpose bot made by zach.#0001 + others.

# Features

- Moderation Commands
- Advanced Ticket System
- Leveling System
- Economy - NOTE: In EcoDB.js insert your mongodb login into 'connectionURI' string. ik its in your config.json file but it is not adding to the db for some reason when i const it.
- ~~Music~~ this is held off due to the limited documentation on the discord-player website
- ~~AI Image Generation~~ - same reason with music commands

I know a lot of features have been cut off but I will try my best to find replacements!
